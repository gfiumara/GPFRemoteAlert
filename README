GPFRemoteAlert aims to implement a mechanism to display a UIAlertView at
pre-determined points in your app (startup, launching a certain view, ...)
without having to ship an update to the app.  A property list file is maintained
on a remote server and is pulled to the app.  Future revisions may implement a
database backend.
